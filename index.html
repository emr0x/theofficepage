        <p id="ending"> All in all, the Office has given me hope and laughter. Working in an office day after day is always portrayed to be so boring and sad, however, the Office has showed me that it is not. There are so many individual people  with their own quirks, and the Office has made me feel so much better about the daily office life which simply used to seem so depressing. This show will save you from a bad day. It will save you from a good day. It is simply one of the best shows that was ever made. As Michael would say... the only time I set the bar low is for limbo, and the Office has definitely not set the bar low for TV shows. </p>
